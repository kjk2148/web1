Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup Language for <strong> creating web pages </strong> so, i really like it.

<img src="">

<p style="margin-top:45px;">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">This is some text in a paragraph.</p>

<h1>W3C</h1>

<p>Be not afraid of greatness.<br>
Some are born great,<br>
some achieve greatness,<br>
and others have greatness thrust upon them.</p>

<p><em>-William Shakespeare</em></p>
